I am a 5th Year PhD candidate in Department of Neurobiology and Behavior. I am passionate about Computational Neuroethology, using tracking and programming. I want to study ethology through an algorithmic perspective, and understand if there are general principles of behavior across species. I am also interested in the neural basis underlying behavior, with special interest in ensemble activity of the neurons generating the behavior.

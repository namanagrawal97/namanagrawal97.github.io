## PhD Thesis
[Yapici Lab](https://yapicilab.com/index.html) | Cornell University | 2021-

I worked on characterizing "Local Search" Behavior in Drosophila. I used simple foraging arena with an overhead camera to observe a fly's behavior as it foraged for food. I then constructed ML models to predict which state the fly is in depending on its kinematic parameters. I observed that the extent of Local Search behavior was dependent both on the Food Quality and Hunger levels of the fly.

I conducted a large screening of the SEZ neurons to understand which neuron integrated information about the food quality and hunger levels to send information to motor neurons which resulted in Local Search Behavior.

## MS Thesis
[Schnell Lab](https://mpinb.mpg.de/en/research-groups/groups/neurobiology-of-flight-control/research-focus.html) | MPINB Bonn | 2019-2020

I worked on activation of descending neurons in *Drosophila* VNC to test which neurons control turning maneuver during flight. I found that unilateral activation of AX neurons with P<sub>2</sub>X<sub>2</sub> led to suddern ipsilateral turns mid-flight.

## Summer Internship
[Brembs Lab](https://lab.brembs.net)| University of Regensburg | Summer 2018

I studied neurobiological mechanisms of spontaneous behavior and operant feedback in Dopaminergic subpopulations in *Drosophila* brain using optogenetics. I made Drosophila crosses and tested the progenies in a custom designed T-maze for optogenetics. I wrote R scripts for analysis of collected data.

## Summer Internship
[Kunte Lab](https://www.ncbs.res.in/faculty/kunte)| NCBS Bangalore, India | Summer 2017

* Modelling of Bird vision and Color analysis using RStudio
* Analysis of Butterfly population data of Bengaluru using RStudio

## Summer Internship
[MAD Lab](http://tinalab.weebly.com)| InStem-NCBS Bangalore, India | Summer 2016

I dissected *Drosophila* larvae and collected lymph glands to observe differences in stem cell proliferation under Dopaminergic Transporter KO and WT.

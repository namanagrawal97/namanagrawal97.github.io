# Mentoring

I made a website to onboard students who worked under me to understand the basics of Drosophila Biology and How to work with them [find here](https://namanagrawalneuro.notion.site/Training-in-Drosophila-Neuroscience-b6f3928e2bcb4ca59d0b07cfb757aee7)

Successfully mentored several undergraduates, who have since excelled and achieved notable success in their current
endeavors:

* Sophie Gustin, current position - Senior Undergraduate student at Cornell University
* Catherine Schweiger, current position - Senior Undergraduate student at Cornell University
* Claire Makino Duan, current position - Research Technician, Harnett Lab, MIT
* Joshua Dov Epstein, current position - Clinical Research Associate - Recovery Without Walls
